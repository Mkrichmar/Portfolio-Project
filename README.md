# Portfolio-Project
The following files consist of my online portfolio.
There you will find a Home page, an About page, and a Portfolio page, as well as a corresponding CSS style sheet and JavaScript file.
The content of the portfolio is information about me, my journey through coding, and my personal interests.
I made several updates to this portfolio, including style and content additions to render the aesthetic of the site as reflective of my taste.

I hope you enjoy and look out for further updates as they are pending!
